1. Install Dependencies

First, you’ll need to install Flask, Celery, and a message broker (like Redis). You can install these using pip:

pip install Flask Celery redis

brew install redis

Make sure you have Redis installed and running, or you can use another broker supported by Celery.

2. Create a Flask Application with Celery

refer app.py

Explanation of the Code

	•	Flask Setup: A simple Flask app is created with two routes: one to start a task and another to check the status of the task.
	•	Celery Configuration: The CELERY_BROKER_URL and CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND are configured to use Redis. Celery is initialized with the Flask app configuration.
	•	Long-Running Task: The long_running_task simulates a long operation using time.sleep(). This function can be replaced with any task that takes time to complete.
	•	Routes:
	•	/start-task: Accepts a JSON payload with the number of seconds to simulate and starts the long-running task.
	•	/task-status/<task_id>: Returns the status of the task along with the result if it’s complete.

3. Running the Application

	1.	Start Redis: Ensure that Redis is running. You can usually start it with the command:

redis-server


	2.	Run the Flask Application:

python app.py


	3.	Start the Celery Worker:
Open another terminal and run:

celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=info

This command tells Celery to use the app’s celery instance to start processing tasks.

4. Testing the Application

You can use a tool like curl or Postman to test the application.

	•	Start a Task:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/start-task -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"seconds": 10}'

This will start a task that takes 10 seconds to complete and will return a task_id.

	•	Check Task Status:
Use the task_id returned from the previous request to check the task’s status:

curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/task-status/<task_id>

Replace <task_id> with the actual task ID you received.
